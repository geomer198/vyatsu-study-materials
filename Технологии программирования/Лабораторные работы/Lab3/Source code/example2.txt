The hunk range information contains two hunk ranges. The range for the hunk 
of the original file is preceded by a minus symbol, and the range for the 
new file is preceded by a plus symbol. Each hunk range is of the format l,s 
where l is the starting line number and s is the number of lines the change 
hunk applies to for each respective file. In many versions of GNU diff, 
each range can omit the comma and trailing value s, in which case s defaults 
to 1. Note that the only really interesting value is the l line number of 
the first range; all the other values can be computed from the diff.

The hunk range for the original should be the sum of all contextual and 
deletion (including changed) hunk lines. The hunk range for the new file 
should be a sum of all contextual and addition (including changed) hunk lines. 
If hunk size information does not corespond with the number of lines in the 
hunk, then the diff could be considered invalid and be rejected.

Optionally, the hunk range can be followed by the heading of the section or 
function that the hunk is part of. This is mainly useful to make the diff 
easier to read. When creating a diff with GNU diff, the heading is identified 
by regular expression matching.[11]

If a line is modified, it is represented as a deletion and addition. Since 
the hunks of the original and new file appear in the same hunk, such changes 
would appear adjacent to one another.[12] An occurrence of this in the 
example below is:
